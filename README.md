The repository, ant-pheromone, contains the program, pheromoneModel.py.
This program demonstrates that a single pheromone model accounts for certain experimental observations of foraging behavior in big headed ants.

The experimental paper and original two pheromone model is:
"The role of multiple pheromones in food recruitment by ants"

Our paper offering a one pheromone model is:
"A Single-Pheromone Model Accounts for Empirical Patterns of Ant Colony Foraging Previously Modeled Using Two Pheromones"
submitted to the journal, Cognitive Systems Research.

The program runs in Python 3.
