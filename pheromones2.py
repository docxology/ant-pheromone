#"The role of multiple pheromones in food recruitment by ants"
#A. Dussutour, S. C. Nicolis, G. Shephard, M. Beekman, and D. J. T. Sumpter
#J Exp Biol. 2009;212: 2337â€“2348. doi:10.1242/jeb.029827

#Let us  assume ants put down the same kind of pheromone whether exploring or
#exploiting / gathering.  But they put down more when exploiting, to leave a
#stronger trail for where to go.  We'll assume that pheromone decays exponentially
#with time.
#
#There are two experimental conditions, the E+F vs E condition, and the E+F vs N condition.
#The E+F branch has pheromone after the ants have both explored and exploited.
#The E branch has pheromone after the ants have only explored, but not exploited.
#The N branch has no pheromone.
#
#Our hypothesis is that the E+F branch leaves a lot of pheromone, say, 10, and
#the E branch leaves a small but significant amount of pheromone, say, 1.
#So exploiting leaves 10 times as much pheromone as just exploring.
#
#When there are good amounts of pheromone, then the measurement of
#which path has more pheromone is clear.  Preferably choose the path with more.
#When there is skimpy amount of pheromone, then hedge bets by allocating
#traversals to both paths.
#
#We decompose the computation into two stages, signal amplification, and
#path preference.
#
#This file contains two top level functions that produce branch preference
#curves.  One function is for Dussutour Experiments 1 & 2, and another uses
#the same model to simulate Dussutour Experiment 4, "dynamic environment."
